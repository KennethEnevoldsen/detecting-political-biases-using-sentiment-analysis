# Detecting Political Biases using Sentiment Analysis

This is the scripts used for the article, ['Analysing Political Biases in Danish Newspapers Using Sentiment Analysis', by Enevoldsen and Hansen 2017](https://tidsskrift.dk/lwo/article/view/96014).

If you were to repeat this or a similar sentiment analysis in Danish I suggest you use Sentida [(Lauridsen, Dalsgaard &  Svendsen, 2019)](https://tidsskrift.dk/lwo/article/view/115711) or [Asent](https://github.com/kennethenevoldsen/asent).



**Note** 
that the python script is for python 2 and the dataset used is in three folder (since the data was collected over three sessions).
